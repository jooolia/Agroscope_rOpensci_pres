-   Making the right data, tools and best practices more **discoverable**
-   Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse **community**
-   Promoting **advocacy** for a culture of data sharing and reusable software
-   Building **capacity** of software users and developers and fostering a sense of pride in their work

-   Automated checks occur 
-   Editor in chief decides if the package is a good fit or not 
-   Handling editor assigned (often with more domain knowledge)
-   Handling editor looks for reviewers
-   Reviewers review package in the open on github
-   Authors respond and fix things based on comments
-   Reviewers respond
-   Once everyone is satisfied the package can be approved and becomes a part of the rOpenSci umbrella.
